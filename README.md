# Python Mini Tools üêç

This repository contains small Python tools that I have built to make everyday tasks easier. Currently, it includes two useful tools: a Speed Test App and a Server Ping Monitor.

- Simple and easy-to-use Python script.
- Great for quickly checking your network performance.

### 2. Server Ping Monitor

- Notifies you when the server is online or offline.
